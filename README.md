WSPPacker by [Plumsail team](http://plumsail.com)
=========

## Synopsis

This project it is open source plugIn for popular file manager [Total Commander](http://www.ghisler.com/). 
It allows you to work with WSP/CAB archives (It very usefull if you're **SharePoint** developer)

## Motivation

My main motivation was to get a simplest way to edit WSP packages, without constantly extracting/packing folders.

## Installation

To install the plugIn just navigate to [Release tab](https://github.com/RFlipper/WSPPacker/releases)
and install the following files: 
* TcPlugInLib.msi - *this is dot net wrapper*
* WSPPacker.zip - *this is plugIn archieve*, just open it from Total Commander

## Post Scriptum

Also I've tested in [Unreal Commander](http://x-diesel.com/) it works well.
