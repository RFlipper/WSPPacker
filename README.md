=========

## Synopsis

This project it is open source plugIn for popular file manager Total Commander. 
It allows you to work with WSP/CAB archives (It very usefull if you're **SharePoint** developer)

## Motivation

My main motivation was to get a simplest way to edit WSP packages, without constantly extracting/packing folders.

## Installation

To install the plugIn just navigate to [Release](https://github.com/RFlipper/WSPPacker/releases)
And install: 
* TcPlugInLib.msi - *it is dot net wrapper*
* WSPPacker.zip - *it is plugIn*, just open it from Total Commander
